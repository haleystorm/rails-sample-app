# Ruby on Rails Sample Application

This application demonstrates that I, for the most part, possess the ability to follow a simple tutorial ([Getting Started with Rails](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v5.0/getting_started.html)).

Tutorial includes
* Adding routes
* Generating a controller
* Writing CRUD methods in Controllers
* Using partials to clean up duplication in views
* Creating Models (Articles and Comments)
* Running Migrations
* Model relationships
* Adding links
* Adding some validation
* Basic Authentication (Differs slightly from tutorial. Instead of having user and password hard coded into the controller I read them from credentials.yml)

Main branch is automatically deployed to Heroku. Check it out [here](https://young-hollows-77189.herokuapp.com/). *Requires log-in for some features.*

* Ruby version 2.7.2
* Rails version 6.1.3
